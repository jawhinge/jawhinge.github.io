# I'm always criminally curious

My name is Георги. George if slavic languages are not your strong suit. I like to explore. Making things makes me happy. I'm sometimes late. I'm not a morning person. I like to work at night when the world has settled and there's peace and quiet. I have a cat. I make music and sometimes people like it.   

Here's what you need to know at a glance:  

I'm a **programmer** and I might be currently looking for a job.    
I **produce and record electronic music**.  
I **make cassette tapes** when I am bored.  
I am a **certified HAM** radio operator. (**LZ1GND**)  
I am **always** looking to collaborate on something fun.

I do a lot of the following:

- Music
- Web Development
- Marketing content creation
- Tinkering with machines you might find in your dad's boxes in the attic 

If you've got more questions or **are willing to pay me for one of the above**, hit me up - all the contact links are in the footer.  
On every page.  
On the whole website.  
Neat, right?
