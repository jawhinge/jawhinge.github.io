# This is a hobby gone very wrong

**I do music**. It's not *"this"* music or *"that"* music but it's some sort of music that I do.  

Quite frankly it's not where I want it to be. You will see controversial words and topics on this page and that's ok because this is a space for self expression. 

I am working on my **third album** which will at least be technically way higher than my previous two. I estimate it will be done by **fall 2021**

My whole journey with music has to do a lot with the pleasure **I** get from it and not **you**. But if you like it and think it has the tiniest bit of value for you, we're already friends.

## Albums

### The Idiot Faced The Crowd - 2019

This album happened while I was self-teaching myself into a web development career. I was miserable throughout the entire making of it. Half of it is done on an OP-1. Other half on a destitute Electribe 2 Sampler.

### Pathfinder - 2017

This was my first effort to put out some music. It was entirely a learning experience and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing but it was a blast.
