# This is a hobby gone very wrong

**I do "music"**. It's not what you expect of music. It's not even what I expect of music.

It makes me happy and it makes the dozen people listening to it happy too. It's a good thing, that. Happy and all...

I am working on my **fourth album**. 

It's a very subjective and personal thing. I've never felt like being in a band or doing any sort of collaboration, I just want to sit in my dusty music space and just have a good old time on my own with my overly expensive toys that a 12 year old laptop could replace. But hey, why not?

## Albums

### Jawhinge - 2022

I named this one so because with it I finally found my place in music and finally put some concentrated effort into making what I like to hear. It's still a wank but it's the best one so far. Also the last album that featured any sort of PC-oriented production. By the end of it I had already gone DAW-less.

### The Idiot Faced The Crowd - 2019

This album happened while I was self-teaching myself into a web development career. I was miserable throughout the entire making of it. Half of it is done on an OP-1. Other half on a destitute Electribe 2 Sampler.

### Pathfinder - 2017

This was my first effort to put out some music. It was entirely a learning experience and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing but it was a blast.
