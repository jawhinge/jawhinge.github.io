My first attempt at a website was way back in 2013 or 2014. It followed after I was gifted a free hosting voucher. Soon enough, though, I realized I have nothing to put on it and that was that. I was a 17 year old with high hopes and no fucking idea what to do with my life (now I only got no idea). Through the years, on and off, I've come up with different variations of my initial WordPress-powered humble digital abode but it didn't satisfy. And let's not think back to this time I was honest-to-god blogging about things because it makes me cringe in ways that can harm my body.

## 7 years later, I come in peace

I decided it's time to set up a whole new digital home and keep it alive. The main problems I previously had on this mission were: 

- It costs money
- Its price makes it a big commitment that I can't be bothered with
- I don't have anything to show to the world
- It costs fucking money I DO NOT WANT TO SPEND

### The money problem

*How do you host a website for free?*

Well, there's always the option of endless myspace-esque site-thingamajig providers but they're way way way too limiting. No control over your page (which I could half-assedly get around) and - most of all - I don't want .wix.com on my domain.

***Commercial free hosting sucks and domains are basically the Onlyfans of web development.***
#### BUT

One day not long ago and almost incidentally, I stumbled upon a site hosted on GitHub pages and it was beautiful and functional. It was made on something called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that worked through a language called [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to boil [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and a bunch of configs into a proper HTML/CSS/JS combo. Kinda like a hipster [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) except the end result is readable. I liked it. 

Some googling later it turns out you can point custom domains to a GitHub pages repo. And that Markdown stuff, you could customize it to your heart's content with straight-up HTML but you can also keep it simple (read - lazy). That's already way more flexible and significantly more *free of charge* than most alternatives out there. I thought this was going to be complicated but let me tell you: 

#### This website was made in a couple hours.

### I'm not the interesting type of nerd

Well, it turns out I do a whole shitload of weird stuff that couldn't be all that interesting to anyone. But they're interesting to me so I'll document and archive them here. The weird hobbies. The strange topics. The interests that **DO NOT** get me laid. I don't really care if someone reads it. I'm not going to advertise it but I will religiously show it to anyone who brings up a topic that I've touched here. Don't be a stranger <3
