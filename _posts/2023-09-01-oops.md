## I had better things to do, okay?

In the unlikely event that I decide to do any more write-ups for this site, someone is undoubtedly going to see the dates on the posts and wonder wtf happened. Life happened. Here's a short update

- I released an album (which is the reason I'm reviving this site)
- I got a proper job that requires me to actually work.
- Various other things that won't matter when I'm dead

***Please enjoy your stay, I might skip another couple years***
