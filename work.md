# I am an up-front front-end web developer

My strengths are my infinite curiosity, my personal approach to my team and work and an innate ability to follow simple instructions :)

#### Q and A for inquisitive recruiters/employers:

**What is the biggest challenge you recently faced?**

I recently had to migrate multiple apps in our mono repo to a new authentication model (explicit code flow with PKCE, auto login on all routes). The means to access user data changed, lots of checks, observables, different maps had to be moved around in NgRx effects and the routing flow changed entirely. 

**3+ years of experience and you're still mid, why?**

In 2019 a former employer needed a webmaster/light web development for their network of 12+ sites. At that time I was in marketing for them, they offered me to make the switch **while teaching myself**. This ultimately culminated in me developing and maintaining a web-store on my own and from scratch. 

However, being the only developer, my tasks were few and simple and I had no projects to push me further (which is why I ultimately quit to pursue an actual career in the field).

**What is your biggest weakness/strength?**

üëçI'm really curious and like to see things through even if it means grinding out boring tasks for days.

üëéI'm lazy and easily demotivated by lack of feedback/unfair environment. 


**What other technologies have you worked with?**

Technologies I have a non-professional interest in or have used very scarcely through various jobs but am open to using:

- Almost any major CMS and shop system
- Various cybersecurity technologies
- Node.js
- A headless CMS called Strapi (has a special place in my heart)
- MongoDB and Mongoose
- Python with Scrapy
- Express.js and React.js
- P5js
- Microsoft Business Central
